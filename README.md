- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the standard library
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
