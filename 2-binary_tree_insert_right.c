/**
 * binary_tree_insert_left - Inserts a node as a left-child of
 *                           of another in a binary tree.
 * @parent: A pointer to the node to insert the left-child in.
 * @value: The value to store in the new node.
 *
 * Return: If parent is NULL or an error occurs - NULL.
 *         Otherwise - a pointer to the new node.
 *
 * Description: If parent already has a left-child, the new node
 *              takes its place and the old left-child is set as
 *              the left-child of the new node.
